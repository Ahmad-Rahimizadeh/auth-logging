# auth-logging
this is simple python app that alerts you for failed login to your remote servers using slack. you can use other apps to get notice but i used slack here.

#install requirements using pip3 install -r requirements.txt

before using this you need to setup your ELK stack and pars your auth log files to ELK stack. you can use this repository for that.
