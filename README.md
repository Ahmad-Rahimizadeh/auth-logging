# auth-logging
this is simple python app that alerts you for failed login to your remote servers using telegram. you can use other apps to get notice but i used telegram here.
make sure you have created a telegram bot and telegram channel. don't forget to add telegram bot to your channel as an administrator.

install requirements using below command:
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```  

before using this you need to setup your ELK stack and pars your auth log files to ELK stack. you can use this repository for that.
